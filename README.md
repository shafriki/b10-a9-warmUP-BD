# Project Name: WarmUP Bangladesh [Live Link](https://shafriki-warmup-bd.surge.sh/)

## Short Description
**WarmUP Bangladesh** is a React and Firebase-based platform that connects donors with volunteers to provide warm clothing to people in need across Bangladesh. The web application allows users to log in, view donation campaigns, and donate winter clothes via a simple form, helping vulnerable individuals, especially in rural and low-income areas, stay warm during the colder months.


## Problem I Have Faced
During the development of **WarmUP Bangladesh**, I faced challenges with Firebase authentication, as it was my first time integrating it. I also struggled with loading data and managing routes in React Router. Using AOS Package, Animate.css for animations presented difficulties, and working with new React npm packages added to the learning curve. Despite these obstacles, I successfully overcame them and completed the project, gaining valuable experience. Alhamdulillah.
